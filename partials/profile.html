	<h3>Resourcefulness. Creativity. Perseverance.</h3>
	<p>My name is Ulysses Lin and I am a junior developer and recent graduate of <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/" target="_blank">Coding Dojo</a>, a prestigious full stack coding bootcamp in Bellevue, WA. I currently looking for a back-end developer position, though I am open to front-end work as well.</p>
	<p>I earned top marks at Coding Dojo, <span class="pink">one of only two to pass all exams on the first try in a cohort of 15.</span> At Coding Dojo, I received holistic, intensive training in MVC frameworks, database use, front-end design, back-end OOP, and more for 60-70 hours a week for 14 weeks.</p>
	<p>I have diverse experience as an editor, designer, and teacher and I strongly believe this allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectives.</p>
	<p>As a founding editor of an academic journal and an editor of various curricula, I have a sharp, critical eye and this helps me make code more elegant, concise, and comprehensive. <span class="pink">As an editor, I know how to look at what other people have written and follow and enhance their style and content.</span></p>
	<p>My experience as a freelance graphic designer and production assistant means I create efficient, aesthetic, intuitive products with carefully crafted hierarchies of information. I love analyzing and visualizing data in infographics. In addition, as a teacher, I understand methodologies for expressing new information clearly.</p>
